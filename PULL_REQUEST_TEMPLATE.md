Pull request title
------------------

The format of the Pull request title must be:

    <component>: <short_change_message> #<issue number>

Possibly with a `keyword <https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/>`_ to close issue
automatically when the Pull request is merged. e.g.:

    <component>: <short_change_message> Fix #<issue number>
