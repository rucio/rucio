Contributor Guide
=================

* Thank you for participating!
*  Please ensure that an `issue <https://github.com/rucio/rucio/issues/new>`_ exists before submitting your contribution as a pull request.
* The issue should contain the motivation, modification and expected results (discussions usually happen there).
* No pull request will be merged without an associated issue (release notes are generated from issues).
* You should make sure to add your name (and organisation) to `AUTHORS`_.

A contribution can be either be a **patch**, **feature**, or **hotfix**:
 * **Patches** include bugfixes and minor changes to the code and are included in patch releases usually made on a bi-weekly schedule.
 * **Features** include major developments or potentially disruptive changes and are included in feature releases made multiple times a year.
 * **Hotfix** are specific patch releases happening due to the necessity of important fixes.

Accordingly, the `repository <https://github.com/rucio/rucio/>`_  consists of three different branches:
 * the **master** branch includes the patch/minor development of the current major version.
 * the **next** branch includes the development for the next major version.
 * the **hotfix** branch includes the patch for hotfix releases.

Thus, on release day of a feature release both master and next are the same,
afterwards they diverge until the next feature release.
Pull requests for **features** are only made against the **next** branch.
Pull requests for **patches** are made against the **next** and **master** branch, as
these bugfixes need to be represented in both branches. Thus two
pull requests are needed for patches, and the helper scripts do it
automatically for you.

Setting up the repository
=========================

**Step 1**: Fork the `repository <https://github.com/rucio/rucio/>`_ on Github.

**Step 2**: Clone the repository to your development machine and configure it::

  $ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USER>/rucio/
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/rucio/rucio.git
  # Optional to track changes on the next branch
  $ git branch --track next

Contributing
============

**Step 1**: Create an `issue <https://github.com/rucio/rucio/issues/new>`_ with the description
of the contribution (motivation, modification and expected results).
Every issue will get a **unique issue number**.

**Step 2**: Create a local branch that corresponds to the issue. There are utility scripts to help you with this::

  $ ./tools/create-patch-branch <unique issue number> '<component> #<issue number>: <short_change_message>'
  $ ./tools/create-feature-branch <unique issue number> '<component> #<issue number>: <short_change_message>'

**Step 3**: Commit your change. The format of the commit message must be::

<component>: <change_message> Fix #<issue number>

Valid component names are listed in the `label list <https://github.com/rucio/rucio/labels>`_

**Step 4**: Push the commit to your forked repository and create the pull request(s). There is a helper script to assist you::

  $ ./tools/submit-pull-request

**Step 5**: Watch the pull request for comments and reviews. For any pull requests update,
please try to squash/amend your commits to avoid "in-between" commits.

Automatic Review
================

Every submitted pull request will automatically be run through automated review and
testing(nosetests) with Travis.

Human Review
============

Anyone is welcome to review merge requests and make comments!

All collaborators, thus the Rucio core development team can approve, request
changes or close pull requests. When a pull request receives an approved review,
it is merged by the librarian, the component maintainer or a collaborator (in order of
availability).


Coding Style and testing
========================

We use flake8 and pylint to sanitize our code. Please do the same before
submitting a pull request.
