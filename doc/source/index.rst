multiple institutions and organisations. Rucio has been developed by
`the ATLAS experiment <https://atlas.cern/>`_.

Rucio offers advanced features, is highly scalable, and modular. It is a data management
solution that could cover the needs of different communities in the scientific
domain (e.g., HEP, astronomy, biology).
