"""
Conveyor FTS Throttler is a daemon that will configure a fts storage's transfer settings
depending on how many time out errors occur at the storage. If a storage has substantial amount
of transer failures due to time outs, it is usually due to bad connectivity and the amount of failures can be
alleviated by limiting the transfer settings of FTS transfers on the particular fts storage.
