# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Rucio follows a release policy, based on [semantic versioning](https://semver.org),
with **major** (named) releases. Approximately every 4 months we produce a major 
release with a version number like **x.0.0** (with x > 0). This release line is 
maintained with minor/patch releases published every two weeks.

Typically once a year we will designate a release line a **Long-term Support** (LTS) 
release line. This release line will be supported with **security** and **critical** 
patches for approximately two years. It is foreseen to have an overlap of at least 
12 months between two LTS release lines, to give communities a comfortable time 
window to deploy the new LTS release.

**Release lines other than the latest and active LTS ones are not maintained!**

For further information, including the current list of maintained release lines, 
read the [release policy](https://rucio.cern.ch/documentation/started/releasepolicy) 
on the Rucio documentation.
