# Code of Conduct

Please note that all interactions on [Rucio](https://rucio.cern.ch)-supported
infrastructure, such as GitHub repositories, mailing lists, Mattermost channels, etc. are
subject to the [CERN Code of Conduct](https://hr.web.cern.ch/cerns-values-and-code-conduct).

In general, this means that everyone is expected to be **open**, **considerate**, and
**respectful** of others. We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
